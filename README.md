## ABOUT ME

I'm 26 years old and have been learning JavaScript for a little over a year.

I am a motivated and goal-oriented aspiring developer, eager to achieve a high level of expertise in frontend development. Although I currently lack work experience, I possess qualities such as diligence, persistence, and responsibility, which enable me to quickly acquire new skills and confidently move towards my goals.

My main objective is to become proficient in creating modern and engaging user interfaces, including developing complex 3D animations using ThreeJS. Additionally, I aim to deepen my knowledge in backend development to create not only visually appealing but also secure and reliable web applications.

I am confident that my dedication to continuous learning and pursuit of excellence will allow me to make a significant contribution to any projects I become involved in.
